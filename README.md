# INCOST

ðŸ“±ðŸ“¶ INCOST also called as Internet Connection Status is an Android application which enables the user to understand its Network Status and Information. This is a compact Android application made by me which has a dynamic appearance which makes the user experience better.
The application enables you to understand the bandwidth speed of the Internet, Online Status and the Mode of connection to the Internet (i.e. Mobile Data or Wi-Fi).
The Share button within the Application could be used to share the Android application with other Android Users using WhatsApp, E-mail etc.
